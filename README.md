# Kaeo LLM Proxy

A Windows system-tray application that acts as an Ollama API-compatible proxy, translating
requests from any Ollama client to one or more [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp)
servers running their built-in OpenAI-compatible `/v1/` API.

## Why this exists

[Ollama](https://ollama.com/) clients (Open WebUI, Continue, etc.) expect the Ollama REST API.
[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) speaks a slightly different OpenAI-compatible
API. This proxy sits in between — you point your clients at `localhost:11434` and it routes each
request to the right llama.cpp instance, doing all format translation transparently.

## Features

- Translates the Ollama API to llama.cpp's OpenAI-compatible format
- Supports streaming (NDJSON) and non-streaming completions
- Model name mapping — map any Ollama model name to the actual model loaded in llama.cpp
- Per-mapping upstream URL and timeout — route different models to different servers
- Request logging with [LiteDB](https://www.litedb.org/) (auto-archived by size, auto-expired by age)
- Application logging via [Serilog](https://serilog.net/) with rolling files
- System tray application — no console window, always available in the background
- Portable deployment — all data stored alongside the executable, easy to move or back up

## Supported Ollama Endpoints

| Incoming Ollama endpoint | Forwarded llama.cpp endpoint   |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `GET  /api/tags`         | `GET  /v1/models`             |
| `POST /api/show`         | `GET  /v1/models/{model}`     |
| `POST /api/generate`     | `POST /v1/completions`        |
| `POST /api/chat`         | `POST /v1/chat/completions`   |
| `POST /api/embeddings`   | `POST /v1/embeddings`         |

## Portable Folder Structure

All configuration and data files live in a `Data` folder next to the executable for easy
backup and portability:

```
Kaeo LLM Proxy.exe
Data/
  settings.jsonc          # Configuration file
  logs/
	app/                  # Application logs (Serilog, rolling)
	requests/             # Request logs (LiteDB database files)
```

## Configuration

Edit `Data/settings.jsonc` to configure:

- **Listen address** — bind to localhost, `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces), or a specific IP
  - `localhost` (default) — only accessible from the local machine
  - `0.0.0.0` — accessible from the network (may require admin rights or a `netsh urlacl` entry)
  - A specific IP — binds to a particular network interface
- **Listen port** — default `11434` (the standard Ollama port)
- **Model name mappings** — each mapping specifies:
  - Ollama model name (how clients request it)
  - llama.cpp model name (the model name the upstream server knows)
  - Upstream URL (e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:8080`) — each mapping can point to a different server
  - Timeout in seconds (default: 300)
- **Logging preferences** — minimum log level, file size limits, retention period

### Network Access Note

To allow connections from other machines on your network:
1. Set `ListenAddress` to `"0.0.0.0"` in `settings.jsonc`
2. If running without administrator rights, add a URL ACL reservation:
   ```
   netsh http add urlacl url=http://+:11434/ user=DOMAIN\username
   ```
   Replace `DOMAIN\username` with your Windows account name.

## Usage

1. Run `Kaeo LLM Proxy.exe` — it starts minimised to the system tray
2. Double-click the tray icon (or right-click → Open) to open the dashboard
3. Add model mappings with the name your clients will use and the upstream llama.cpp URL
4. Use **Fetch Models** to pull available model names from a running llama.cpp server
5. Point your Ollama-compatible client at `http://localhost:11434` (or your configured port)
6. The proxy routes each request to the correct llama.cpp instance and translates the response
